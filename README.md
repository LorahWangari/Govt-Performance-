Government Performance Dashboard  

🚀 Power BI Project Alert!
I just completed a data storytelling project analyzing Nigeria’s economic indicators across different leadership eras using Power BI. 📊

This dashboard showcases:
✔️ Average Unemployment & Inflation Rates by Leadership
✔️ Growth in Agriculture
✔️ Government Debt Trends (1990–2022)
✔️ Industry vs Services Contributions

🔍 Objective: To explore how various administrations impacted economic growth and sector performance — especially in key areas like agriculture, unemployment, and services.

🛠 Tools used:
Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | Visual Design

📈 This was a great way to practice insights generation and use data to inform policy conversations.

Would love your thoughts — what other indicators would you add?
